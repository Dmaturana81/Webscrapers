      " Beam Therapeutics, Inc. is a biotechnology company committed to creating a new class of precision genetic medicines based on our proprietary base editing technology, with a vision of providing life-long cures to patients suffering from serious diseases.\n",
      "The most common class of genetic mutations are errors of a single base, known as point mutations. These point mutations represent approximately 58% of all the known genetic errors associated with disease. Other natural genetic variations of a single base among human populations, revealed by population-level genomic studies, are known to protect against disease. To maximize the impact of these genetic insights, the ability to alter the human genome at the foundational level of genetic information – a single base – is crucial.\n",
      "Our proprietary base editing technology enables a potential new class of precision genetic medicines that targets a single base in the genome without making a double-stranded break in the DNA. This approach uses a chemical reaction designed to create precise, predictable and efficient genetic outcomes at the targeted sequence, which we believe will dramatically increase the impact of gene editing for a broad range of therapeutic applications. We believe we will be able to rapidly advance our portfolio of novel base editing programs by building on the significant recent advances in the field of genetic medicine.\n",

      "http://www.kyvernatx.com Kyverna is innovating cell therapy as a potentially curative approach to autoimmunity. Unlike current immunomodulatory treatments known to provide incremental disease control through chronic dosing, cell therapy holds the promise of appropriately modulating the immune system through a single – or relatively few – infusion(s) to achieve optimal and long-lasting disease control. We believe that Kyverna’s engineered cells have the potential to address the underlying mechanisms of autoimmune disease with the additional benefits of improving safety and tolerability by minimizing toxicity associated with current treatments. Kyverna is leveraging multiple approaches drawn from its SmarTcellTM Genetic Engineering Toolbox. Using our technology platforms – synReg-T cells (synthetic regulatory T cells) and synNotch CAR-T cells (chimeric antigen receptor T cells) – we are programming immune cells with instructions to suppress or eliminate pathogenic cells in the diseased tissues in which they are exerting their deleterious effects. Our initial disease targets are diseases for which there are no approved treatments, or for which the results of existing treatments could be further improved. In the absence of an approved treatment, physicians will often try out other medicines, exposing patients to the side-effects of these medicines with no demonstrated efficacy for the patients’ disease. This reality underscores the pressing need to come up with better solutions for patients. While treatments exist for other autoimmune diseases (e.g. Inflammatory bowel disease or IBD), a significant portion of patients are refractory and would benefit from new approaches. In January 2020, the company announced a $25M Series A investment from Vida Ventures, Westlake Partners, and Gilead. At this time, the company named industry veteran Dominic Borie, MD., Ph.D., an accomplished immunologist, digestive tract and liver transplant surgeon with extensive drug development experience from Genentech, Roche and Amgen, as the company’s Chief Executive Officer. Kyverna also announced it had entered into a strategic collaboration and license agreement with Gilead to develop engineered T cell therapies for the treatment of autoimmune disease based on Kyverna’s synthetic regulatory T cell platform and synNotch technology from Kite, a Gilead company.\n",

The platform has evolved from research conducted at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (OHRI), a world-recognized leading centre in the translation of oncolytic virus therapies. With decades of experience developing viral medicines, Virica is solving some of the crucial development challenges facing viral medicine developers that are caused by the natural defenses that animal cells have against viruses. Numerous studies have shown that combinations of VSe molecules increase yields of several important virus types by between 2x to 100x, and can also enhance the production of therapeutic cells, such as CAR-T cells, which are time-consuming and costly to produce. In general, use of VSe technology can result in significant manufacturing efficiencies and cost-savings for our clients. Virica creates, licenses and sells unique formulations from its small molecule library to substantially enhance the efficiency of virus manufacturing processes and reduce cost of goods of its clients, which could span from pharma to biotech to contract manufacturing operations. Virica has obtained exclusive rights for the OHRI to commercialize VSe technology.
